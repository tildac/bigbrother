### Big Brother  

![Mathilda Christensson](images/bigbrotherartwork.png?raw=true "Mathilda Christensson") 

This sketch was inspired by digital surveillance art. I have always found these works of art fascinating in that they depict the subjects of surveillance footage, who are often oblivious to the governmental constructs tracking their movements. Being from London, where CCTV cameras are especially high in numbers, I wanted to consider creating a work of art that emphasized this notion of being constantly watched. 

In this sketch I included a white image of Jeremy Bentham's panopticon. He constructed this idea of a system of control in the late 18th century, and it was a design that was intended for use to monitor prisoners. In the panopticon the prisoners can be viewed at all angles and at all times, however, the prisoner themselves is unaware of when they are being watched and by whom. By placing an image of the panopticon diagram in the background, I wanted to highlight the subject of the work from the offset, and additionally address the development of this construct in the late 18th century to present day through the emergence of digital surveillance. 

The mouse has been used for various functions. Firstly, when it is pressed an image of the shutter of a camera lens appears. Secondly, when the mouse is dragged triangular shapes flutter across the screen and can be dragged in various directions (these shapes are intended to resemble the movement of drones in our atmosphere). Thirdly, when the viewer goes to click on the panopticon a circle appears over it and changes colour with each interaction. 

Through these three functions I aimed to alert the viewer to the experience of interacting with being the surveillor, rather than the one being surveyed. While we are aware of surveillance in our daily lives, we have little opportunity to experience being in the position of surveilling others. Through this sketch I tried to trigger this experience in a somewhat abstract manner. The birdseye view of overlooking the drones moving, coupled with the viewers ability to move them, in addition to clicking on the circle encompassing the omniscient panopticon structure, hollistically places the viewer in the position of power. Now, the interactor of the sketch gets the opportunity to be Big Brother.
